This is a Telegram bot that polls the website where the homework results for the grade bonus "Grundlagen: Betriebssysteme und Systemsoftware" are published. Whenever the results for a new week are come online, it notifies the user of any changes and also sends the test output for any new or changed results.

*(Not yet implemented)* New Users can register by using `/register GROUPNUM`, replacing GROUPNUM with the number of your GBS homework group. Unregistering works analogously.

The bot is hosted by me and can already be used (though registration is not yet possible through telegram).
